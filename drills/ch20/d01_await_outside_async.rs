//! DRILL 20-01 · await outside async
//!
//! PREDICT without compiling: what happens when this program is built and run?
//! Answer ok, panic, error, or the error code(s), e.g. E0382.
//! EXPECT: ?
//!
//! Run `cargo drill ch20`. Then FIX it with the smallest change that keeps
//! every line marked KEEP and makes the program run cleanly.
//! Ask: where is `.await` allowed?
